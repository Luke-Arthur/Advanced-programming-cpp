# My CSCI251 Advanced Programming (Spring 2023) - C++ Code Repository

Welcome to my C++ code repository for the CSCI251 Advanced Programming course at UOW (University of Wollongong) during Spring 2023. This repository is designed to store all my C++ projects, assignments, and related files for this course. Below, I'll provide an overview of the main contents and guidelines specific to this course.

## Contents

1. **Assignments**: This directory is where I'll store all my assignment submissions for the CSCI251 course. Each assignment should have its folder with a clear and descriptive name indicating the assignment number and topic.

2. **Labs**: This directory is for the lab exercises and solutions related to the CSCI251 course. I'll organize the lab folders by lab number and include any necessary source files and documentation.

3. **Projects**: If there are any larger-scale projects or group projects in the course, I'll place them in this directory. Each project should have its folder with an informative name.

4. **Code Snippets**: I'll use this directory to store small and reusable C++ code snippets, algorithms, or utility functions that might be handy for various assignments and projects.

5. **Documentation**: This directory is meant for storing any course-specific documentation, including lecture notes, project guidelines, or any reference materials provided during the course.

6. **Exams**: If there are any code-related exams, I'll keep their solutions and relevant materials in this directory.

7. **Miscellaneous**: For any other C++ code or files that don't fit into the above categories but are still relevant to the course, I'll use this directory.

## Guidelines

1. **File and Folder Naming**: I'll use descriptive names for folders and files, including assignment numbers, lab names, or project names. Clear naming conventions will help me quickly locate specific materials.

2. **Version Control**: It's highly recommended to use version control (e.g., Git) to manage my code. I'll create separate branches for each assignment or project, and make sure to commit my changes regularly.

3. **Documentation**: Whenever I submit an assignment or complete a lab, I'll include a README file within the folder that describes the purpose of the task, any challenges faced, and the approach used to solve it.

4. **Code Style**: I'll adhere to the coding style guidelines provided by the course instructor or use a widely accepted C++ coding style to maintain consistency across my projects and assignments.

5. **Testing**: For each assignment or project, I'll try to include relevant test cases and testing code to verify the correctness of my solutions.

6. **Academic Integrity**: I'll make sure to follow the course's academic integrity policy and avoid plagiarism or any unauthorized collaboration in my assignments.

7. **Backup and Security**: I'll regularly back up my repository to prevent data loss. I'll keep my repository private or share it only with trusted collaborators to ensure the security of my code.

8. **Collaboration**: If I am working on group projects, I'll communicate effectively with my team members and use appropriate tools to manage collaborative work.

## Conclusion

This README file provides an initial guide to my C++ code repository for the CSCI251 Advanced Programming course during Spring 2023 at UOW. As the course progresses, I'll feel free to modify and update this file or add more information based on the specific requirements of each assignment or project. Best of luck with my studies and coding projects!

Best regards,
