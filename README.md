# My CSCI251 Advanced Programming (Spring 2023) - C++ Code Repository

Welcome to my C++ code repository for the CSCI251 Advanced Programming course at UOW (University of Wollongong) during Spring 2023. This repository is designed to store all my C++ projects, assignments, and related files for this course. Below, I'll provide an overview of the main contents and guidelines specific to this course.

## Contents

1. **Assignments**: This directory is where I'll store all my assignment submissions for the CSCI251 course. Each assignment should have its folder with a clear and descriptive name indicating the assignment number and topic.

2. **Labs**: This directory is for the lab exercises and solutions related to the CSCI251 course. I'll organise the lab folders by lab number and include any necessary source files and documentation.

3. **Projects**: If there are any larger-scale projects or group projects in the course, I'll place them in this directory. Each project should have its folder with an informative name.

4. **Code Snippets**: I'll use this directory to store small and reusable C++ code snippets, algorithms, or utility functions that might be handy for various assignments and projects.

5. **Documentation**: This directory is meant for storing any course-specific documentation, including lecture notes, project guidelines, or any reference materials provided during the course.

6. **Miscellaneous**: For any other C++ code or files that don't fit into the above categories but are still relevant to the course, I'll use this directory.


This README file provides an initial guide to my C++ code repository for the CSCI251 Advanced Programming course during Spring 2023 at UOW. As the course progresses, I'll feel free to modify and update this file or add more information based on the specific requirements of each assignment or project. Best of luck with my studies and coding projects!

Best regards,
Enso
